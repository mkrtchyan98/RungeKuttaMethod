# RungeKuttaMethod
Mathlab code of Runge-Kutta Method
This simple MATLAB code is made for numerically solving the first-order ordinary differential equation, dy/dx=func(x,y), using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.
#how does this work
There are 4 parameters that you can adjust in RungeKutta.m:a,b,N,u0:
To start your calculation, please run the code RungeKutta.m calling dfRK function with giving parametrs
